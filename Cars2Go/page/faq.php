                    One of the many great things about Car Rentals is our rental rates and services are guaranteed to be the very best in the industry. If you come across a lower price from a competitor and the rate is on a comparable vehicle including the same terms, locations, and rental car fees we will be glad to beat the price for you.

                    A driving license is not needed since a driver is already provided by the Company, But in a case where the customer wants to drive the car himself, a driving license is needed.
